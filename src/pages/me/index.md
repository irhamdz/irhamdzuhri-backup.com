### Background
I was born in Bekasi, Indonesia. always curious as sh*t about everything I don't know, and loves to try new things, especially in programming things. I am a back-end developer (and just a little bit front-end) since 2016, My first backend language was PHP using Codeigniter Framework, I use it for doing my bachelor's final thesis project for almost 1 year. 
<br> <br>
At the end of 2017, I got my first official job as a programmer using Nodejs and Loopback Framework with Reactjs as a client-side. for me, it was not that hard switching to a new programming language. 
<br><br>
Two years later (still counting) at the new company, I become a professional back-end developer using python with Django and Django Rest framework who falls in love with the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/) method.
